      <h1> New York City is turning six peaker power plants into renewables. <br> Here's what that means for the state. <br> <br> <br> By: Audrey Carleton <br> Date: November 16, 2020 </h1>

      <p class="georgia-font center">

        Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, has spent years trying to move the city away from its reliance on peaking power plants.
        <br>
        <br>
        Better known as ‘peaker plants,’ these fossil fuel power plants
        are only run a few times each year, when there’s peak demand from the city’s grid, like during extreme weather events. Despite their infrequent use, peaker plants tend to emit health-damaging pollutants like carbon dioxide and particulate
        matter at higher rates per unit of energy generated than traditional power plants. There are currently 16 across the city,
        and, according to Bautista, all are primarily located in low-income communities of color.
        <br>
        <br>
        “On the hottest days of the year, the most polluting power plants get turned on, and they are in the communities with worse, already, air quality or public health profiles,” Bautista says. “Whether it's COVID, whether it's climate change,
        pick the indicator: People of color will tend to have worse outcomes.”
        <br>
        <br>
        He’s currently leading a group of five environmental justice organizations, known together as the PEAK Coalition, which recently announced plans to work with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to transition six of the city’s peaker plants
        into renewable energy stations for solar, wind or battery power. Many of these plants were built before or around 2000, and according to Bautista, were passed without a complete environmental impact review using technology that is now
        dangerously out of date.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to an original analysis of 2018 data on power plant emissions from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (EGRID), low-income counties across New York are facing higher
        emissions burdens from power plants of all kinds – peaker and otherwise – across the state. I linked 2018-19 income data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s to EGRID emissions data and found that regions where the median income is lower
        than the state average are 16
        per cent more likely to be home to plants that emit higher-than-average annual levels of methane, a fossil fuel known to be up to 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its warming effect on the atmosphere.
        <br>
        <br>
        An analysis of recorded emissions from 139 plants across the state also shows a correlation between income and exposure to methane from power plants; counties where median household income falls above the state average are, on the whole,
        exposed to lower levels of methane than those where the median household income is higher than the state average.

          On the whole, New York's higher-emitting fossil fuel infrastructure is located in vulnerable communities; the city's peaker plants are clustered in low income pockets of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens, that are already facing high
          cumulative
          burdens from existing industrial activity. "[Communities in the] Bronx do have a really high cumulative burden of environmental pollution and the peakers are one part of that," says Elena Krieger, director of research at PSE Healthy Energy.

          While Krieger says peakers are only one part of
          the
          city's and state's pollution story, she believes
          starting a just transition in the state's most burdened environmental justice communities is the best way for NYPA to go. The Bronx tops the list of places to start.
          <br>
          <br>
          A geospatial analysis of carbon dioxide, methane, and PM2.5 emissions across the state of New York show that the majority of counties with the highest total annual emissions levels are upstate – with Albany and
          Allegany topping the list.
          While 9 of the top ten counties by emissions are upstate, the Bronx is the only downstate county to make this list.

          For Bautista, transitioning even a handful of peaker plants toward renewables, like solar and wind, represents the culmination of a 20-year fight – and he sees this as a central step in achieving New York's climate goals. "Other fights
          and
          other issues have come up over the years," he says. "But it's always been
          something that has been in the back of our mind."
